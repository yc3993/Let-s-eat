# Let-s-eat
Nowadays, there are a lot of software for customers to recommend restaurants
or things. Users can get restaurant recommendations that are more in line with
their own tastes through their own historical information and the dining infor-
mation of other users. However, we found that there is no good service for group
dining on the market. software. In fact, there are many similar scenes in daily
life. Many times we do not go to dinner alone, and it is difficult to make a de-
cision if we do not agree. To solve this problem, we propose the idea of making
recommendations for groups.
